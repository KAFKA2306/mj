## Features

### 1. **AI Model Implementation**
Based on the 2024 research "Tjong Transformer", utilizing hierarchical decision-making models to analyze tile discards.

### 2. **Quantitative Metrics**
- **Expected Value (EV)**: Score evaluation for each discard.
- **Win Probability**: Monte Carlo simulation results.
- **Risk Assessment**: Safety analysis based on defensive theory.

### 3. **Performance**
Optimized engine using bitwise operations for low-latency performance on standard web browsers.
